Greenvolt Nexus: Revolutionizing EV Charging with Solar Energy
Introduction
Greenvolt Nexus is a revolutionary platform designed to address the growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging through sustainable, transparent, and efficient solutions powered by solar energy. Our mission is to build a resilient EV charging network that reduces carbon footprints and enhances accessibility.
Problem Statement & Market Research
The rapid adoption of EVs has outpaced the growth of charging infrastructure, leading to range anxiety among users. Additionally, most charging stations depend on fossil fuels, undermining the environmental benefits of EVs. According to industry reports, India's EV market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 36% between 2023 and 2030, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable charging solutions.
Competitor Analysis
